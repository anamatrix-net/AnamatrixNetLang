# AnamatrixNetLang
"AnamatrixNetLang" is a great mashup name that combines the words "analog", "matrix", "net", and "lang". It's a memorable and unique name that suggests a programming language built on a combination of analog and digital technologies, with a focus on complex networks and interconnected systems. The name implies a language that is both advanced and versatile, with the ability to handle complex programming tasks with ease. Overall, I think it's a strong name for a GitHub repository or programming language.

# TODO
1. Determine the language's purpose and goals: This step involves defining the purpose and goals of your programming language. For example, you might want to build a language that's designed for data science, machine learning, or game development. You'll also need to define the key features and functionality of your language, such as syntax, data types, control structures, and functions.
2. Choose a language design and syntax: Once you've defined your language's goals, you'll need to decide on a language design and syntax. This involves defining the syntax for key programming concepts, such as variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements. You'll also need to choose a language paradigm, such as object-oriented, functional, or procedural.
3. Build a lexer and parser: The lexer is responsible for breaking down the code into individual tokens, such as keywords, operators, and identifiers. The parser then takes these tokens and builds a syntax tree, which represents the structure of the code. The syntax tree is used to validate the code and generate an executable form.
4. Implement the language features: With the lexer and parser in place, you can start implementing the language features. This involves defining the behavior of variables, functions, control structures, and other key programming concepts. You'll also need to define the data types that the language supports, such as integers, floats, and strings.
5. Build a compiler or interpreter: Once your language features are defined, you'll need to build a compiler or interpreter to translate the code into machine-readable instructions. A compiler generates executable code from the source code, while an interpreter executes the code directly.
6. Test and refine the language: Finally, you'll need to test and refine the language to ensure it works as intended. This involves writing test cases, debugging code, and iterating on the language design to improve its usability and functionality.
